# Covid-19 DashBoard

## Inspiration
With my interest in microservices and the Full Stack architecture increasing I wanted to switch from Java SpringBoot + React + MySQL and try out full stack development with the Python language, a language I newly learned due to interest in machine learning, and the Flask framework. With that in mind I wanted to recreate a Covid-19 Dashboard as a starter mini project and then move on from there.

## Daily Update - 7/21/2020
Added a basic HTML page that has a table and a Frame that access the CDC government data.
